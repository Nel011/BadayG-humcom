                <h2>What is an acoustic guitar?</h2>
                <p>An acoustic guitar is a fretted musical instrument that produces sound via vibrating strings above a hollow 
                chamber in the guitar’s body. The vibrations carry through the air and do not require electrical amplification.
                Most acoustic guitars have six strings. The most common variation on this is a 12-string guitar, where each string 
                is doubled with another string sounding the identical pitch, creating a rich chorus effect. Acoustic guitar players 
                produce sound with both their fingers and a pick. This varies depending on the genre of music, the type of guitar used, 
                and the player’s personal preference.</p>

                <h2>What are the types of acoustic guitars?</h2>
                <h3>The Classical Guitar</h3>
                <p>The original acoustic guitars were quite similar to today’s nylon string guitars. Classical guitars, Spanish guitars, 
                and their various derivations all fit the “nylon string” category.</p>
                <h4>Here are some of their characteristics:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The guitars are made of hollow wood with a large sound hole. Spruce is the most common material for guitars.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        These guitars typically have wide, flat necks that allow the guitar strings to be spaced fairly far apart.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Nylon string guitars have a mellow tone with strong resonance in lower-mid frequencies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Traditionally, the strings of these guitars were made with “catgut” (literally dried intestines), but nylon is the prevailing material today.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The Steel String Guitar</h3>
                <p>The category for steel string guitars are much wider compared to its counterpart, the nylon string guitars.</p>
                <h2>Here are some of their characteristics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This category includes most of the acoustic guitars used in rock, folk, country, and blues music.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The body construction is similar to a nylon string guitar, but with more frequent deviations in body shape and size.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some steel guitars are made of metal, such as the resonator guitar. But these instruments, which are played with a slide, are less commonly used by beginners.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The necks tend to be narrower and more rounded than on nylon string guitars. Most necks are rosewood, although pau ferro is another popular wood.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Despite the category name, “steel string” guitars may feature strings made of nickel, aluminum, and other metals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The metal strings give these guitars a much brighter, treble-focused sound that projects at louder volumes.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Changes to the acoustic guitar</h2>
                <p>The early acoustic guitars are classical guitars wound with steel strings. Although classical guitars 
                long ago used catgut strings made from sheep intestines before switching to nylon strings, this guitar 
                instead used steel strings. The strings were wound using a pegbox-just like a classical guitar.
                Dynamic guitars were known for producing bigger sound since they used steel strings instead of nylon strings. 
                The shape and thickness of the body was subsequently modified to produce an even bigger sound-one more step closer 
                to perfecting the acoustic guitar.</p>
                <p>Older guitars are thinner, while newer ones have a thicker body. A thinner body produces a cleaner 
                sound, and while that is certainly not a bad thing, modern players prefer a fuller sound over a smaller 
                instrument, and so guitars have tended to get thicker as time goes on.</p>
