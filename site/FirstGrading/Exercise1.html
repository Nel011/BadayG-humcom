                    <u>The Sandman</u> is an American comic book written by <u>Neil Gaiman</u> and published by DC Comics. It is a story about <br>
                    <u>Dream</u> of the Endless, also known as <u>Morpheus</u> many names, along with his siblings <u>Destiny, Death, Destruction, Desire, Delirium,</u> <br>
                    and <u>Despair </u>. At the start of the series, <u>Morpheus</u> is captured by an occult ritual and held prisoner for 70 years. <br>
                    Morpheus escapes in the modern day and, after avenging himself upon his captors, sets about rebuilding his kingdom, <br>
                    which has fallen into disrepair in his absence. It is an <font color="red"><b><i>amazing</i></b></font> series to read as it is filled with <font color="red"><b><i>fascinating</b></i></font> stories <br>
                    about magic and horror. I found it <font color="red"><b><i>interesting</i></b></font> to read because I was bored and picked it up quickly. Before I knew it I <br>
                    started alloting more time in reading every volume I found on the internet.
