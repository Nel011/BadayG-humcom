        <center></center><h1>How to Assemble a Basic Computer Step-by-Step Guide</h1></center><br>
            <p>This set of instructions will help you assemble a basic computer capable of running most <br>
            modern software encountered by a casual user. Modern computers become more affordable when users <br>
            supplement their monetary investment with a few hours of effort. This computer build is very basic <br>
            and will be the minimum hardware necessary to have a functional system. After you have all of the <br>
            parts and materials needed, it will take you some time to assemble your computer using simple hand <br>
            tools available at your home.</p>

            <h3>Things You Need to Know Before Building a Computer</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Anyone can build a computer with the right preparation and set of instructions.</li>
                <li>Building a computer yourself ensures that you can meet your required preferences.</li>
                <li>While deciding on which components to buy consider reasearching the individual parts or other's recommendations online.</li>
                <li>Carefully consider the computer parts that you buy and make sure that all of them are compatible with each other.</li>
                <li> Most components come with additional parts; some optional, some required for installation in your build. You need to organize them <br>
                    to not get confused.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Components needed for building the computer.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Workspace</li>
                <li>Screwdrivers</li>
                <li>Zipties & Scissors<i> For organization</i></li>
                <li>Computer Case</li>
                <li>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</li>
                <li>Motherboard</li>
                <li>Memory (RAM)</li>
                <li>Graphics processing unit (GPU) <i>This is optional</i></li>
                <li>Storage</li>
                <li>Power supply unit (PSU)</li>
                <li>Operating system(OS)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Here are some details about the list above.</h3>
            <ul>
                <p><b>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</b> also known as the processor, is basically the brain of your PC. <br>
                    When a computer program runs, it sends a list of instructions to the CPU. The CPU performs each instruction <br>
                    and sends signals to other components to let them know when they need to perform a task. Has cooling a fan <br>
                    included.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Core Count</b> tells us how many tasks the computer can perform simultaneously.</li>
                        <li><b>Clock Speed</b> tells us how quickly the computer can perform the task.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p><b>Motherboard</b> is the main circuit where everything is connected to. The CPU sits directly on top of the board <br>
                    and both must be compatible with each other. There are a selection of motherboards based on size. Depending on the <br>
                    case or the components the most common form factors are the Extended ATX, ATX, microATX, and the Mini-ITX.
                    </p>
                <p><b>Memory or RAM</b> is the PC's short-term memory. This is where the PC stores and access data that is currently active. <br>
                    More RAM means better performance but too little RAM is the opposite. To not waste money, you should spend depending on <br>
                    your budget, preference, and the compatibility to the motherboard. </p>
                <p><b>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) </b> is used in a wide range of applications, including graphics and video rendering. <br>
                    They’re best known for their capabilities in gaming.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Integrated Graphics</b> are less powerful than discrete graphics but it is all you need for a basic build <br>
                            These processors are integrated with the CPU.</li>
                        <li><b>Discrete Graphics</b> powerful components that plug into the motherboard via PCIe, and come with their own resources, <br>
                            including video memory and (usually) an active cooling system.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p><b>Storage</b> are devices where you can store long-term memory.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Solid State Drive (SSD)</b> are fast and reliable flash memoryused in a USB drive to store data.</li>
                        <li><b>Hard Disk Drive (HDD)</b> use mechanical arms, and a spinning platter to store and retrieve data.</li>
            </ul>
                <p><b>Operating System</b> is a critical piece of software that assists in managing communications between a computer’s hardware and programs.</p>
        </ul>
            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
            <ul>
                <h4>Prepare the computer case</h4>
                <p>There are different sizes of computer cases, make sure the components are compatible with the case and vice versa.</p>
                <h4>Here are some details about the different sizes.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Full-tower cases</b> are designed to fit both Extended-ATX motherboards and standard full-size <br>ATX motherboards. They usually measure around 22-24 inches tall, 18-20 inches long, and more than 8 inches wide.</li>
                        <li><b>Mid-tower cases</b> are designed to fit standard full-size ATX motherboards. Generally speaking, mid-tower is the <br>most common case size. Their dimensions can vary quite a bit, but these cases usually measure around 18-20<br> inches tall, 17-20 inches long, and 6-8 inches wide.</li>
                        <li><b>Mini-tower cases</b> , or small form factor (SFF) builds, are compact and designed to fit a number of smaller <br>motherboards, such as mini-ITX motherboards.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h4>After preparing all the things you need now you can start building by doing the following: <br></h4>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Installing the CPU </li><br>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Unpack the CPU and the motherboard carefuly and find the cpu socket.</li>
                        <li>Refer to the instructions that come with the motherboard and CPU.</li>
                        <li>Remove the socket tray by sliding the lever to the side gently.</li>
                        <li>Usually you align the small arrow on the CPU on the CPU socket on the motherboard.</li>
                        <li>Once you correctly socketed the CPU, pull down the lever back to its original position.</li>
                        <li>Here is an image for reference.</li> 
                    </ol><br>
                    <li>Installing the storage M.2 SSD (Optional)</li><br> 
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>First, find the M.2 slot on your motherboard. It's a small, horizontal slot with a tiny screw across from it.</li>
                        <li>Remove the screw.</li>
                        <li>Slide the M.2 SSD gently into the slot. When it's fully seated, it will stand off the motherboard about a 35-degree angle. <br>Push the SSD down and replace the tiny screw to lock it in place.</li>
                    </ol><br>
                    <li>Installing the CPU cooling system</li><br>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Consult the instruction manual of the cooler for exact installation.</li>
                        <li>The motherboard may have brackets installed. You may need it or you may not unless the cooler uses a different bracket.</li>
                        <li>The coolers may have thermal paste or thermal pad pre-installed, if the cooler has none, you have to manually apply it before seating the cooler to the CPU.</li>
                    </ol><br>
                    <li>Installing the RAM</li><br>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Look for the RAM slots in your motherboard & determine the number of slots (2 or 4).</li>
                        <li>If you are going to fill all the slots, simply lift the tabs on the side and snap the RAM sticks into place.</li>
                        <li>Otherwise, consult the user manual for the correct configuration and populate the slots accordingly.</li>
                    </ol><br>
                    <li>Installing the power supply</li><br>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Find the slot where the power supply would go. Usually on the bottom side of the case.</li>
                        <li>Look for the perforated side of the slot and align it with the fan on the PSU when installing it.</li>
                        <li>If you're using a non-modular or semi-modular power supply, now is the time to run the attached cables <br>through the case to where they'll need to end up</li>
                    </ol><br>
                    <li>Installing the motherboard</li><br>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>If your motherboard came with an attatched IO shield, (a rectangular sheet of metal with cutout for the motherboard's ports) snap it to the cutout. Be sure to orient it correctly.</li>
                        <li>Before installing the motherboard, make sure the wires are routed correctly.</li>
                        <li>After that, screw in the motherboard. Refer to the user manual for the position of the screws relative to the case.</li>
                    </ol><br>
                    <li>Installing storage</li><br>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Same as the PSU, you can find slots or stack bays for the storage in the case. They may have little plastic switches, <br>in which case they are tool-free bays, or they may just look like metal brackets.</li>
                        <li>If you have tool-free bays, each bay will have its own plastic lever or switch. Open or unlock the lever or switch and <br>you should be able to pull out the tray.</li>
                        <li>Place the drive and screw it in.</li>
                        <li>If you don't have tool-free bays, you'll see a metal bracket (it will be big, like a sheet), with slats or holes in it.</li>
                        <li>To put a drive in one of these "bays," all you have to do is slide the drive between the metal bracket and the side of your <br>case and screw it into place.</li>
                        <li>Once your drives are all in place, connect them to the motherboard (using a SATA cable, which should have come with either <br>your drive or your motherboard) and to the power supply.</li>
                    </ol><br>
                    <li>Installing operating system</li><br>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Before installing the operating system make sure the the pc has no errors turning on and all the components are connected properly.</li>
                        <li>Plug in the USB flash drive that contains your OS, as well as a monitor, mouse, and keyboard, and turn on your PC.</li>
                        <li>First, you'll want to check to makes sure your components are all installed and being recognized. Find the page in BIOS that <br>shows your PC's system info (different motherboards have different BIOS setups, but you should be able to find a <br>screen that gives you this information) and check to make sure the system is recognizing everything you've installed so far.</li>
                        <li>Next, navigate the BIOS until you find the Boot page (may be called "Boot Order" or "Boot Priority"). Change the boot order so <br>that your flash drive is first and the drive you want to install your OS on (if you're using an SSD as a boot drive, <br>you will want to install the OS here) is second.</li>
                        <li>Restart your computer. Your computer will boot from the USB and the OS installer will pop up. Follow the instructions to finish <br>the installation.</li>
                    </ol><br>
                </ol>
            </ul>
            <p>Now we are done assembling the computer. Remember that this guide is for basic computers only. This is not 100% accurate and it is reccomended <br>that you follow the instructions on the manuals that came with the components.</p>
